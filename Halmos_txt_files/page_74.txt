honest about the most important idea behind it; the act of choosing an elment from a non-empty set was repeated infinitely often. The mathematician experienced in the ways of the axiom of choice will often offer such an informal argument; his experience enables him to see at a glance how to make it precise. For our purposes it is advisable to take a longer look.

Let $f$ be a choice function for $X$; that is, $f$ is a function from the collection of all non-empty subsets of $X$ to $X$ such that $f(A) \in A$ for all $A$ in the domain of $f$. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the collection of all finite subsets of $X$. Since $X$ is infinite, it follows that if $A \in \mathcal{C}$, then $X - A$ is not empty, and hence that $X - A$ belongs to the domain of $f$. Define a function $g$ from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{C}$ by writing $g(A) = A \cup \{ f(X - A) \}$. In words: $g(A)$ is obtained by adjoining to $A$ the element that $f$ chooses from $X - A$. We apply the recursion theorem to the function $g$; we may start it rolling with, for instance, the set $ \meptyset $. The result is that there exists a function $U$ from $\omega$ into $\mathcal{C}$ such that $U(O) = \emptyset$ and $U(n^{+}) = U(n) \cup \{ f(X - U(n)) \}$ for every natural number $n$. Assertion: if $v(n) = f(X - U(n))$, then $v$ is a one-to-one correspondence from $\omega$ to $X$, and hence, indeed, $\omega$ is equivalent some subset of $X$ (namely the range of $v$). To prove the assertion, we make a series  of  elementary observations; their proofs are easy consequences of the definitions. First: $v(n) \in ' U(n)$ for all $n$. Second: $v(n) \in U(n^{+})$ for all $n$. Third: if $n$ and $m$ are natural numbers and $n \le m$, then $U(n) \subset U(m)$. Fourth: if $n$ and $m$ are natural numbers and $n < m$, then $v(n) \neq v(m)$.  (Reason : $v(n) \in U(m)$ but $v(m) \in ' U(m)$.) The last observation implies that $v$ maps distinct natural numbers onto distinct elements of $X$; all we have to remember is that of any two distinct natural numbers one of them is strictly smaller than the other. 

The proof is complete; we know now that every infinite set has a subset equivalent to $\omega$. This result, proved here not so much for its intrinsic interest as for an example of the proper use of the axiom of choice, has an interesting corollary. The assertion is that a set is infinite if and only if is equivalent to proper subset of itself. The "if" we already know; it says merely that a finite set cannot be equivalent to a proper subset. To prove the "only if," suppose that $X$ is infinite, and let $v$ be a one-to-one correspondence from $\omega$ into $X$. If $x$ is in the range of $v$, say $x = v(n)$, write $h(x) = v(n^{+}); if $x$ is not in the range of $v$, write $h(x)= x$. It is easy to verify that $h$ is a one-to-one correspondence from $X$ into itself. Since the range of $h$ is a proper subset of $X$ (it does not contain $v(0)$) , the proof of the corollary is complete. The assertion of the corollary was used by Dedekind as the very definition of infinity.
