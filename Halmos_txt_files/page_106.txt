\begin{named}[Cantor's theorem. ] Every set is strictly dominaled by its power set, or, in other words, 

\begin{equation*}
X \prec \mathcal{P}(X)
\end{equation*}

for all $X$. 
\end{named}

PROOF. There is a natural one-to-one mapping $X$ into $\mathcal{P}(X)$, namely, the mapping that associates with each element $x$ of $X$ the singleton $\{ x \}$. The existence of this mapping proves that $X \precsim \mathcal{P}(X)$; it remains to prove that $X$ is not equivalent to $\mathcal{P}(X)$. 

Assume that $f$ is a one-to-one mapping from $X$ onto $\mathcal{P}(X)$; our purpose is to show that this assumption  leads to a contradiction. Write $A = \{ x \in X: x \in ' f(x) \}$; in words, $A$ consists of those elements of $X$ that are not contained in the corresponding set. Since $A \in \mathcal{P}(X)$ and since $f$ maps $X$ onto $\mathcal{P}(X)$, there exists an element $a$ in $X$ such that $f(a) = A$. The element $a$ either belongs to the set $A$ or it does not. If $a \in A$, then, by the definition of $A$, we must have $a \in ' f(a)$, and since $f(a) = A$ this is impossible. If $a \in ' A$, then, again by the definition of $A$, we must have $a \in f(a)$, and this too is impossible. The contradiction has arrived and the proof of Cantor's theorem is complete.

Since $\mathcal{P}(X)$ is always equivalent to $2^{X}$ (where $2^{X}$ is the set of all functions from $X$ into 2), Cantor's theorem implies that $X \prec 2^{X}$ for all $X$. If in particular we take $\omega$ in the role of $X$, then we may conclude that the set of all sets of natural numbers is \textit{uncountable} (i.e., not countable, non-denumerable), or, equivalently, that $2^{\omega}$ is uncountable. Here $2^{\omega}$ is the set of all infinite sequences of 0's and 1's (i.e., functions from $\omega$ into 2). Note that if we interpret $2^{\omega}$ in the sense of ordinal exponentiation, then $2^{\omega}$ is countable (in fact $2^{\omega} = \omega$).
